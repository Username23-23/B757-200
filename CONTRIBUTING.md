As an open source project, anyone can contribute to the project. If you would like to help out, please see the issue tracker to find something that needs to be worked on.

## Issue Management

Issues don't have to be errors or bugs, but can be things that need attention such as a new function or display.

If you would like to submit an issue, please check to make sure it isn't already posted.

Provide as much information as possible in order to help out any developers who would like to work on the issue.

## Contributing

Some fixes can be done through a simple pull request on the github website, but some require the sim. The simplest way to do this is with [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). You can find a guide online on how to pull files from github in one click, and be able to access them on your computer. 

When using github desktop, please add a new commit for every section of work you are doing. This helps keep things organized, and makes it easier for us to look over a pull request. Make sure all pull requests are finished and working. If a pull request has incorrect or partial information, it may be rejected even if everything else is okay. Also, please remove the Packages and PackageInt folders before submitting.

## Opening the aircraft in the simulator

With these source files, you can open the aircraft in the simulator to work on the flight model, instruments, displays, or anything else that requires the aircraft itself. To do this, make sure you have the most recent version of the github files, and enable developer mode in the Flight Simulator settings. After this, click on 'Tools' in the bar at the top of your screen, select aircraft editor, and click 'Load Project'. In this file menu, find your GitHub folder (usually in Documents), and navigate to B757_2.xml. Double click this file to load it into the project editor. 

You should then go to the 'Windows' option in the menu bar and select 'Aircraft Selector'. Scroll to the bottom and select the ParallelFS Boeing 757-200. Once you have this loaded, opent the 'Tools' menu again and select 'Aircraft Editor'. You can then edit parameters and see your changes in-game.
